Server needs to track game state for all of the clients

Clients connect during a 'lobby' period
	could have this based on time, number of players, etc.
		set max players to 10
		Just say that once 3 players join, wait another 15 seconds after the last player, then start the game
			reset timer every time a player joins
	first person to join starts the game
	
		
Not keeping track of deck; assume it is infinite and distribute cards based on probability

server has set of threads (1 for each client, and another as the game master)

Only want one client to be able to play at a time
	
set a loop that goes until someone runs out of cards
