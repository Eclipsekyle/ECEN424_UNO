Server needs to track game state for all of the clients

Clients connect during a 'lobby' period
	could have this based on time, number of players, etc.
		set max players to 10
		Just say that once 3 players join, wait another 15 seconds after the last player, then start the game
			reset timer every time a player joins
	first person to join starts the game
	finalize size of thread list once the game starts
		open it back up once the game ends
	
		
Not keeping track of a limited deck; assume it is infinite and distribute cards based on probability
	generate a random number between 0 and 107 (108 cards in deck)
		need a function that uses a vector/table so that a number input to it grabs the appropriate card
		Game-master implements this

server has set of threads (1 for each client, and another for doing the actual processing?)

Only want one client to be able to play at a time
	
set a loop that goes until someone runs out of cards

Game state
	for the game in general, this tracks who is to play and what card is on the top of the deck
		this has to be provided to each player
		when player(s) gets to 1 card, the game state needs to display that player x is at Uno
	for each player, they have a more specific game state i.e. the hand of cards they have
	GS could be an object, probably have several moving parts behind the scenes
		process GS into a string that should be shown
	GS must be accesed from multiple threads, so this needs to be properly synchronized
		the string idea may be helpful here; only GM thread should change the GS, clients should only read from it


***Flow:
	At start of game, transmit game state to each person
	
	first player to connect goes first	
		default order is connection order (obviously reverse card changes this)
		
	a card is shown, and they must type in a card in their hand to player	
		once it is a players turn, unlock their game i.e. set a scanner to wait for their input
		cards will be shown in ascii using a shorthand for each card name
			ie |color,type| 
				e.g. |R,5| for red 5, |W,D4| for wild card draw 4, 
				will need to provide a small help dialog as reference (readme file)
					maybe send this as a short message on the side
		When they play a card, have (at least) the server check if a valid card was played
			could also have the client check this, but server is master and should still check to be robust
			valid means the card is:
				a possible card they could have e.g. NOT a Pink 2 or Red 15
				in their hand
				valid based on the card on top of the deck
		after a valid card is played, server calculates what should happen
			change game state object accordingly
			if not valid, poll the current player again to get a valid play
			
	After current players turn, game master thread processes what happened and changes state of the game
		e.g. If someone played draw 2, that person has 2 cards added to their deck, and then the subsequent player starts their turn
		alter players hands, change direction of play (if reverse played), generate strings, and send game state to each player
		
		
		
May happen that someone gets a ton of cards in their hands
	probably every X cards, make a new line for them to play on
		assume their terminal is sufficiently wide to not be a problem for our formatting
